  "description": "Moonbeam is much more than just an EVM implementation: it\u2019s a highly specialized Layer 1 chain that mirrors Ethereum\u2019s Web3 RPC, accounts, keys, subscriptions, logs, and more. The Moonbeam platform extends the base Ethereum feature set with additional features such as on-chain governance, staking, and cross-chain integrations.\r\n\r\nMoonbeam combines the best of both worlds: the familiar and easy-to-use tooling of Ethereum and the scalable, interoperable architecture of Polkadot.\r\n\r\nDive into the tools, integrations, and comprehensive tutorials to start using and building on Moonbeam.",
