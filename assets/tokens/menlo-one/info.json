Menlo One decentralized database and Proof-of-Reputation incentive system is the infrastructure that enables the Web 3.0 generation of marketplaces, social media platforms, and future apps to be as fast and performant as their centralized predecessors.\r\n\r\nBuilt on the Ethereum network, Menlo One\u2019s technology offers communication, social, and automation capabilities that were previously unavailable.
