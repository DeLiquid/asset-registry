  "description": "Big Fund Capital DAO is a decentralized autonomous organization that works like an investment fund. In this organization, profits are shared among holders of its tokens. Funds from the treasury are allocated in a basket of investments (defi protocols, tokens, NFTs).\r\n\r\nThese investments generate revenues, which are swapped to AVAX and DIRECTLY DISTRIBUTED to holders according to their share. This means that token holders have a direct impact on the profits of the organization",
