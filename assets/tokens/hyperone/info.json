  "description": "- A parallel, dual-chain ecosystem\r\nThe Hyper One network has two chains running laterally, with each serving different functions within the ecosystem. These two chains serve to provide us with an interlinked, bifocal dual-token, dual-chain ecosystem that will help us solve interconnection, privacy and security issues prevalent in the current blockchain ecosystem.\r\n \r\nThe Hyper One ecosystem will consist of two chains that include the Hyper One (h1) main chain and the Hyper Exchange (HX) chain that is derived from the main chain, but will work towards bridging communication between blockchains including BTC,ETH and others, and non-blockchains such as DAGs",
