  "description": "FarmPoly is a Farmville-inspired metaverse where anyone can earn tokens through gameplay and ecosystem contributions. Players can plant, collect, create and build a farm to raise their animals and crops. The universe of possibilities expands into an open world with downtown real estate, gold and even bitcoin mining.\r\nIn addition to Farmpoly being a fun game, it also takes on the characteristics of a social network and job platform due to a strong community and \"\"play to earn\"\".\r\nThe key difference between FarmPoly and a traditional game is that blockchain's economical design is used to reward players for their contributions to the ecosystem. This novelty game model has been dubbed \"\"play to earn\"\".",
