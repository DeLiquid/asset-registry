  "description": "Shiba Floki which operates on Binance Smart Chain is the latest cryptocurrency that's a descendant of meme father Dogecoin. More specifically, it's a hyper-deflationary subcoin that has a smart sharing system built in ecosystem so every investor gets more shibafloki added to their wallet. This means every card owner gets %5 commission fee for every transaction that takes place. Imagine being able to track fresh new tokens immediately even before they launch while being sure if buying them is safe.",
