Gamers build kingdoms, farm resources, fight monsters (PvE), and compete with enemy kingdoms (PvP) or alliances (MMO) where all the land plots are non-fungible tokens (NFT) along with tokenizable resources, skins, and many other game assets. Currently, the free-to-play strategy game is available on mobile (Android, iOS), as well as on the PC.\r\n\r\nThe project team aims to build a game universe where gamers can have fun together while capitalizing on their digital assets, skills, and play-time.\r\nThe project offers entertaining game content that appeals to not just crypto enthusiasts but also mainstream gamers.",
