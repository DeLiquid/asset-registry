  "description": "\"Peak Finance is a protocol designed to maintain the $PEAK token to the value of $METIS.\r\n$PRO token is a share token earned through the ecosystem via staking $PEAK-$METIS LP. The $PRO token helps maintain $PEAK's peg to the price of $METIS through inflationary epochs. $PRO differs from share tokens due to the transaction taxation mechanics that burn $PRO to replenish the treasury, as well as benefits from diverse revenue streams from partnerships in the ecosystem.\"",
