  "description": "Adshares is a Web3 protocol for monetization space in the Metaverse.\r\nAdserver platforms allow users to rent space inside Metaverse, blockchain games, NFT exhibitions and websites. \r\n\r\nStarting in 2017, the team delivered a protocol that is now highly scalable. Adshares is an umbrella project, maintaining a decentralized network. The idea behind the ADS protocol is to give the network to the community with DAO-style governance. In Adshares, anyone can make their own Adserver by implementing open-source blockchain tools in more and more areas. This breakthrough concept allows $ADS holders to take profit from monetization of the protocol. Crypto projects can advertise using a 100% decentralized marketplace.\r\n\r\nCoins are deflationary due to the native burning and dividend mechanisms.\r\n\r\n$ADS has its own ultra-fast dPoS blockchain, being also cross-chain to Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain and Polygon.\r\n",
