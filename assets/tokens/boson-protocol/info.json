  "description": "Boson Protocol is a trust minimised and cost minimised protocol that automates digital to physical redemptions using NFTs encoded with game theory.\r\n\r\nBoson Protocol\u2019s vision is to enable a decentralized commerce ecosystem by funding and accelerating the development of a stack of specialist applications to disrupt, unbundle and democratize commerce.\r\n\r\nWhat is needed is a way to execute commerce transactions trustlessly with minimized human intermediaries or arbitrators. Our core technology disrupts e-commerce platforms by tokenizing real-world products and services and commerce data within a liquid digital market, built on DeFi. We call this decentralized autonomous commerce.",
