  "description": "Snowbank DAO is the decentralized reserve currency protocol available on the Avalanche Network based on the SB token. Each SB token is backed by a basket of assets (e.g., MIM, SB-AVAX LP Tokens etc etc) in the Snowbank DAO treasury, giving it an intrinsic value that it cannot fall below. Snowbank DAO also introduces economic and game-theoretic dynamics into the market through staking and minting. ",
