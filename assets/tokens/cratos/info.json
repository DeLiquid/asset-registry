  "description": "Cratos is a V2E (Vote to earn) mobile app that a user can generate a vote topic and others can participate in the vote for their answers. Users can get tokens, CRTS, as a reward for their activities on the app, such as registration, vote generation, voting, and commentations. The meaningful vote results will be generated as NFT tokens. Tokens will be used for the payment to our public opinion polls and survey service and the access to the Big data that we have collected. In addition, tokens can stake and farm in the future. With the DID technology, Cratos mobile voting system can replace the conventional election system at a national level.\r\nCratos has achieved 400K+ downloads, and 200K+ registered users on the app as of Feb 11th, 2022.",
