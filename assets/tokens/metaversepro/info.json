  "description": "Metaverse.Pro is the Metaverse Reserve System and $Meta will be the Reserve Currency for the Metaverse and GameFi. This is a fork of OHM on the BSC network, with a focus on the Metaverse and gamification. MetaversePRO is a fair, community-governed, financial infrastructure for the Metaverse that allows for stable and dependable growth. We have chosen to operate on Binance Smart Chain because we believe BSC represents the optimal intersection between the real world and the Metaverse. Plus, the Metaverse on BSC is currently experiencing phenomenal growth, from artworks, to GameFi, to DeFi. All areas are seeing an explosion of innovation. MetaversePRO is committed to building a fair token-issuing institution and to having META accepted across the Metaverse. Just as DeFi requires an infrastructure, MetaversePRO will serve this role for GameFi.",
