  "description": "What is Cartesi?\r\nEase of Adoption: Developers can work in a familiar environment with no artificial limitations and with access to all their favorite tools;\r\n\r\nPortability: Cartesi aims to make DApps portable across the most important public blockchains that support smart contracts;\r\n\r\nPrivacy: DApp states can be kept private among application participants.\r\n\r\nCTSI Overview and Use Cases\r\n\r\nCTSI is a utility token that works as a crypto-fuel for Noether. \r\nStakers receive CTSI rewards by staking their tokens and participating in the network. \r\nNode runners are selected randomly according to a PoS system and gain the right to create the next block. \r\nUsers of the network pay CTSI fees to insert data on the side-chain. \r\nCTSI will also be used for DApps to outsource the execution of verifiable and enforceable computation to entities running Descartes nodes. \r\n",
