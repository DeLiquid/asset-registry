  "description": "APOyield is a deflationary friction less yield project with it's own token called SOUL. Initially the number of SOUL tokens is equal to the number of citizens of earth. With every transaction 2% of the SOULS gets condemned forever and lost in hell. Yet another 8% gets another chance of survival in a shattered form in wallets of all remaining holders.\r\n\r\nAPOyield do also provide yield farming pools on their website.",
