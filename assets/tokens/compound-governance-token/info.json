  "description": "The Compound Governance Token is a governance token on the Compound Finance lending protocol, COMP allows the owner to delegate voting rights to the address of their choice; the owner\u2019s wallet, another user, an application, or a DeFi expert. Anybody can participate in Compound governance by receiving delegation, without needing to own COMP.\r\n\r\nAnybody with 1% of COMP delegated to their address can propose a governance action; these are simple or complex sets of actions, such as adding support for a new asset, changing an asset\u2019s collateral factor, changing a market\u2019s interest rate model, or changing any other parameter or variable of the protocol that the current administrator can modify.",
