  "description": "Ampleforth is a digital-asset-protocol for smart commodity-money.\r\n\r\nThe smart commodity money with a unique elastic supply protocol. AMPL supply expands and contracts in response to it\u2019s price deviating from a 1 USD target. Deviations result in a supply change of AMPLs once every 24 hours, increasing or decreasing the number of tokens in each holder\u2019s wallet pro-rata. Ampleforth is the only asset in the world with this elastic supply property, and therefore has counter-cyclical trading pressure and is uncorrelated with other digital assets such as Bitcoin.",
