BFC also adopts CPoW mining mechanism, which limits the mining participation entry.

There is no longer competition between minors, but cooperation, which makes BFC more secure and trustworthy to stimulate the sustained growth in quotations. Also, commercial mortgage application applies in commercial lending scenarios, such as banknotes, credit loans, leasing services, credit guarantees, risk control, and many other commercial areas. CPoWis based on the PoW mining mechanism with specific conditions requirements. As for BFC, to start mining, pre-store a certain amount of BFC in the wallet is necessary.
